Concept & Aesthetics Inspired From [Centura Health](https://www.centura.org/) & [Regional One Health](https://www.regionalonehealth.org/)
  
  ## Problem & Learnings

  Building the site responsive for smaller displays was the biggest challenge i faced. I took the inspiration of overall aesthetics from Centura Health. Design, Button etc, that overall contributes in the look and feel of the site. This is not an actual website, just front-end of a website, However while brainstorming about the idea, I really liked this and probably build an actual HealthTech product out of it later!

I learnt different ways to design a website and how to deploy project on Github. I took help of font awesome and canva to design logo and background images. i also learnt how to build well structured Readme Files.
